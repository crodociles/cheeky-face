				<p>"Both Cheryl and Lewis are professionals at their services and I have no hesitation in recommending them. Cheryl attends all our Fake Festivals as a face painter and she is exceptional at face painting."</p><br>

				<p>I highly recommend the services of Cheryl and Lewis of Cheeky Face Entertainments. We use them at all of our family events, and they are always professional, creative, enthusiastic and good.<br>They are always good with our visitors, and the balloon modelling is always very well received, as it is something different. Lewis is a consummate professional and is unfazed by the busy demands of a full day entertaining. I cannot recommend them highly enough!</p><br>
